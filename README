Raspberry Pi library for GPIO, 1-Wire, SPI, System Time Counter (STC) access. As
an example of usage there have been provided APIs for handling various popular
devices like wireless nRF24L01 transceiver, DHT temperature sensors (DHT11/22),
Dallas family of temperature sensors (e.g. DS18B20, DS1822, DS1825), HC-SR04
distance sensor, PISO shift register...

API specification contained in the library headers files (see /inc/librasp).
For examples look at /examples.

Expect more sensors support in the future.

1-wire and parasite powering
----------------------------
The original Linux kernel w1 driver (the "wire" module) doesn't provide proper
interface for parasite powering of w1 slaves via userland's netlink protocol.
To handle this issue there has been provided a patch for the kernel allowing
the library to fully support the parasite mode. Look in /kernel directory for
more info.

After the patch is successfully applied, configure the library with
CONFIG_WRITE_PULLUP parameter by updating /config.h and compile it.

Refer to /examples/dsth_list* samples for more info on probing the parasite
powered Dallas family temperature sensors.
