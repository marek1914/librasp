Raspberry Pi library for GPIO, 1-Wire, SPI, System Time Counter (STC) access. As
an example of usage there have been provided APIs for handling various popular
devices like wireless nRF24L01 transceiver, DHT temperature sensors (DHT11/22),
Dallas family of temperature sensors (e.g. DS18B20, DS1822, DS1825), HC-SR04
distance sensor, PISO shift register...

API specification contained in the library headers files (see ./inc/librasp).
For examples look at ./examples.

Expect more sensors support in the future.

1-wire and parasite powering
----------------------------
The original Linux kernel w1 driver (the "wire" module) doesn't provide proper
interface for parasite powering of w1 slaves via userland's netlink protocol.

1. To handle this issue there has been provided a patch for the kernel allowing
   the library to fully support the parasite mode. Look in ./kernel directory for
   more info.

2. RPi uses w1-gpio module as a master w1 driver. The driver need to be configured
   to support bit-banged pullup for parasite powering. Add the following line
   in /boot/config.txt to turn it on the device-tree:
	dtoverlay=w1-gpio,pullup=on
   Reboot RPi after the change.

3. Configure the library with CONFIG_WRITE_PULLUP parameter by updating ./config.h
   and compile it.

Refer to ./examples/dsth_list* samples for details on probing the parasite
powered Dallas family temperature sensors.
