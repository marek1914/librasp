Raspberry Pi library for GPIO, 1-Wire, SPI, System Time Counter (STC) access. As
an example of usage there have been provided APIs for handling various popular
devices like wireless nRF24L01 transceiver, DHT temperature sensors (DHT11/22),
Dallas family of temperature sensors (e.g. DS18B20, DS1822, DS1825), HC-SR04
distance sensor, PISO shift register...

API specification contained in the library headers files (see /inc/librasp).
For examples look at /examples.

Expect more sensors support in the future.
