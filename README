Raspberry Pi library for GPIO, 1-Wire, SPI, System Time Counter (STC) access. As
an example of usage there have been provided APIs for handling various popular
sensors like wireless nRF24L01 transceiver, DHT temperature sensors (DHT11, DHT22),
Dallas family of temperature sensors (e.g. DS18B20, DS1822, DS1825), HC-SR04
distance sensor, PISO shift register...

Expect detailed documentation and more sensors support in the future. For now
look for examples in /examples and /inc/librasp directories for API spec.
