This directory contains a patch file for Linux kernel module "wire", enabling
parasite mode powering of w1 slaves accessible via the w1-netlink interface.

Technically the patch extends w1-netlink protocol by a new command:
W1_CMD_WRITE_PULLUP allowing writing to the bus with a subsequent strong pull-up
time when a direct voltage source is provided to the bus. During the pull-up
there is no activity on the bus until the end of the pull-up time.

The patch should be applied w/o any problems on 3.15 to 4.1 kernels.
To patch the kernel issue:

	patch -p1 -u -d${LINUX_SRC} <w1_netlink_3.15-4.1.diff

replacing ${LINUX_SRC} with a root of the kernel sources.
